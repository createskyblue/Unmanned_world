The front was...
It's really unstable here!
It was a dangerous place. It looked like...crash
I finally got out
There is a flower on it
When the altar was activated but did not hesitate to jump in
Although the prophet left this world
But it gives us a way out
You'll be forced to wake up again whether you want to or not
Making futile efforts
You can't escape because it's part of the world
But the prophet found a solution
Break the blockade with
Leave the cycle of
I'm tired. 
Find a place to rest
Just the rock on the west side
I can't walk any further

Newspaper!
The country opens its corridors to the masses
Newspaper decay
Family photos
A family of three who looked like me were having a picnic

Getting out of the world is the solution, and the government is holding a referendum
Rain world
Slug?
This is the outline of a meeting
The building may have been a former government office
Advanced examination reform document
What do you think of mass suicide
Use unstable particles to reduce population pressure
How to prevent some government workers from committing mass suicide with their family members
I'm not going there
locked
Dangerous house
Danger, keep away
No Wading
It's time to go home
